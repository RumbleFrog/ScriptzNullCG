You currently have 0 post(s)to schedule a task to securely retrieve your backup files from your server, and save them to your local Windows machine.\n\nHow This is Accomplished\nIt may seem this takes a lot of steps, just to get files transferred from your server to your Windows machine, but once it is setup, you can rest comfortably knowing that you have your backup files with you on your local machine, or external backup.\n\nWinSCP is a popular and free secure SFTP client that you can use for transfers. It does everything any other SFTP client does, but it also let's you create batch processes to execute, which is what we'll be using it for.\n\nYour post count must be 5 in order to see this link.

This guide will describe how to use Putty's sister applications, PuttyGEN, and Pageant, to create pub/private keys for your machine so that you can connect seemlessly to your server.\n\nDownloads\nFirst, you'll need to download and install the following applications for this to all work.\nWinSCP:\nYour post count must be 5 in order to see this link.

You currently have 0 post(s)\n\nGenerating a Private Key\nYou need a private key to get access to your server without a password. This private key is stored in the Pageant authentication agent and used when connections are requested with your server. This can be the most daunting procedure for Windows users, but this is completed, connections to your server will be a lot easier.\n\nThe best guide I've used on creating pub/private key pairs can be found here:\nYour post count must be 5 in order to see this link. You currently have 0 post(s)\n\nReading that link, you'll want to create an RSA SSH-2 protocol key. This will allow you to use this key, instead of a password, for other software applications.\n\nSee these images for what PuttyGEN creates and the important things to set:\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n \n\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n \n\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n \n\nOnce you've generated your keys, save your private key in a PRIVATE folder on your local Windows machine, do not share this .ppk file with anybody. Then you can save your public key on your machine, but you'll want to actually save the public key on your server, in the authorized_keys file of your .ssh directory. See the guide above on instructions of how to do that (steps 8.2.9 and 8.2.10). You basically want to copy the contents of the public key file, and insert it as a line (without line breaks!) into your user home directory .ssh directory's authorized_keys file. We set a passphrase with this key because we're going to use Pageant to save the private key and passphrase so that it is available to other applications (WinSCP, Putty, etc.) to use with your server.\n\nUsing Pageant\nPutty's Pageant software simply saves our private key and passphrase so that when our computer starts up, it'll load the private key into memory, and ask us for the passphrase to it just one time. After entering that passphrase, we can seamlessly access our server without needing a password because connections will establish a handshake between the private key/passphrase in Pageant, and the public key stored on the server.\n\nAt this point in the tutorial, you should have generated a private key with a passphrase in PuttyGEN, and stored the contents of the public key on your server in your user accounts .ssh/authorized_keys file.\n\nNow, launch Pageant, if it isn't already, and right click it's icon in the tray and choose \"Add Key\". Navigate to where your private key is stored, and choose it, you'll probably have to enter your private key's passphrase to load it into Pageant.\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n \n\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n \n\nAt this point, Pageant is waiting to use your private key to connections to your server, but it isn't configured to run at startup. To change that, create a shortcut to pageant in your startup folder and change the properties to include your private key when it starts up, such as this:\n\n\n\n\n\tCode:\n\t\n        Properties:\n\"C:\\Program Files (x86)\\PuTTY\\pageant.exe\" c:\\secret\\private\\folder\\private_key\\my_key_for_my_server.ppk\n        \n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\nNow when your computer is restarted, it'll load your private key into memory, and ask you one for the passphrase. You can now test some connections between your machine and Putty (SSH) to make sure your keys are set up correctly. You'll need to configure Putty to try to authenticate with Pageant via this option:\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n \n\nYou'll know that your pub/private keys are working when you connect to your server, and it says it used your private key to connect to it at the top of the Putty window.\n\nCreating A Retrieval Script\nAt this point hopefully, you've got your pub/private keys created, and Pageant configured to use your private key, and have verified that Putty connects (SSH) to your server using that private key.\n\nAs I said earlier, WinSCP is what we'll be using to do the connection to the server and get your files, as it allows batch processing of commands. First, you'll need a script to run, I recommend something like this. The second comment tells you what your schedule task command should look like to run this script. It launches WinSCP console mode, and passes the script (in this case, named winscp_backup_script.txt) to WinSCP to do the transfer.\n\n\n\n\tCode:\n\t\n        # scheduled task looks like this:\n# winscp.exe /console /script=\\\\MyExternalDrive\\Backups\\winscp_backup_script.txt\noption batch on\noption confirm off\nopen [email protected]\n\n#grab the most recent database backup.\nget /usr/share/nginx/backup/mysitebackup.sql.tar.gz \\\\MyExternalDrive\\Backups\\mysitebackup.sql.tar.gz\n\n#grab the most recent code backup.\nget /usr/share/nginx/backup/mysitebackup.code.tar.gz  \\\\MyExternalDrive\\Backups\\mysitebackup.code.tar.gz\n\nexit\n        \nThe script above shows to GET actions to get an SQL and code backupfile, and stores it to an external drive. Of course, you should be able to store the file(s) anywhere that you have access. It is important that Pageant is running and configured with your private key so that the connection in this script can run without a password.\n\nWith this script, you'll probably want to create a scheduled task in Windows to run this task daily, or weekly, or however often you want to get your backup file(s) from your server. Read this page on how to create a schedule task:\nYour post count must be 5 in order to see this link. You currently have 0 post(s)\n\nSee the second line comment of the code above of what your schedule task should execute.\n\nYou may want to run the command yourself from a command line to test the connection and transfer, and make sure there are no other problems.\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n \n\nIf you find out that you don't have your backup files saved to your Windows machine, see if there are any errors in the schedule task log, or run the command manually from a command line to see if it works correctly.","likehref":"posts/1682/like","date":"Oct 6, 2014Oct 6, 2014"}],"xftoken":"78877,1530145667,2f8f1b684199ec5b7611bacf81283f1d4306e9e7"},{"name":"Node and Permission Moderation Settings Explained","href":"threads/node-and-permission-moderation-settings-explained.547/","replycount":0,"views":853,"page":1,"pages":1,"replies":[{"id":"post-642","author":"Nullz","content":"Compatible XF Versions:\n\n1.0\n1.1\n1.2\n1.3\nI encountered some problems figuring this out, and read several threads that attempted to explain how it works but I still couldn't grasp it.

This means that the Follow message moderation rules Permissions setting will reverse the Moderate all messages posted in this forum Node setting, if set to No (not set) (or Never) for that user/group.\n\nExample #1:\n\nIf the Node options has Moderate all messages posted in this forum unchecked, then the Node Rule becomes messages are not moderated.\n\nIf you set Follow message moderation rules to No (not set), this reverses the rule for that user/group, so now all messages are moderated, the opposite of the Node Rule.\n\nIf you set Follow message moderation rules to Allow, then the rule is followed, which in this case means that the messages are not moderated, because that is the Node Rule.\n\nExample #2:\n\nIf the Node options has Moderate all messages posted in this forum checked, then the Node Rule becomes messages are moderated.\n\nIf you set Follow message moderation rules to No (not set), this reverses the rule for that user/group, so now all messages are not moderated, the opposite of the Node Rule.\n\nIf you set Follow message moderation rules to Allow, then the rule is followed, which in this case means that the messages are moderated, because that is the Node Rule.\n\nOne also needs to take into consideration the cumulative permissions feature of xenForo when analyzing their permissions settings as this can be a root cause of issues across multiple user groups\n\nYour post count must be 5 in order to see this link. You currently have 0 post(s)\n\nHopefully this helps a few people.","likehref":"posts/642/like","date":"Jun 13, 2014Jun 13,
